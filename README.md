# logistical-regression-walkjump-app

Stored data, visualized the data, preprocessed the data, extracted and normalized data, trained the classifier, and deployed the model through an GUI.

Collected jumping and walking accerlation data with an app, then creating CSV files to manipulate the data. Visualized the data in various ways, then preprocessed the data by filtering the data using simple moving average. 

Extracted the data by adding features mean, max, min, median, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, variance, and the sum. The features were then normalzied the data. Split the data into training and testing data for the logistical regression. The model is trained using the data and deployed onto a GUI to determine whether the CSV file is jumping or training data.
